    description: "The first-generation Toyota Aqua, marketed as the Prius c in North America and some other markets, was developed as a compact hybrid vehicle aimed at urban drivers seeking maximum efficiency in a smaller package than the standard Prius. Built on a modified Yaris platform but featuring Toyota's Hybrid Synergy Drive system, the Aqua measured just 4 meters in length while offering four-door practicality with a five-door hatchback configuration. Powered by a 1.5-liter Atkinson cycle four-cylinder engine paired with an electric motor for a combined output of 99 horsepower, the Aqua achieved remarkable fuel economy figures of approximately 35-40 km/L (82-94 mpg) in the Japanese JC08 test cycle. The powertrain utilized a continuously variable transmission (CVT) and a nickel-metal hydride battery pack positioned under the rear seat to maintain cargo space. The interior featured a centrally mounted digital speedometer and hybrid system monitor above a conventional dashboard layout, with equipment levels ranging from basic to relatively well-appointed in higher trim levels. Despite its compact dimensions, the Aqua offered reasonable passenger space with a flexible rear seat that could fold to expand the cargo area. Throughout its production run, the Aqua received several updates including a facelift in 2015 that introduced more aggressive styling, improved interior materials, and enhanced equipment options. The model achieved significant success, particularly in the Japanese domestic market where it frequently ranked among the top-selling vehicles overall, appealing to buyers seeking an affordable, practical hybrid for urban environments."

    description: "The second-generation Toyota Aqua builds upon the successful formula of its predecessor while introducing significant technological advancements and quality improvements. Continuing as a compact five-door hybrid hatchback, the new Aqua maintains similar dimensions but features more sophisticated styling with smoother lines, LED lighting, and a more premium overall appearance. The most notable technical innovation is the world's first high-output bipolar nickel-hydrogen battery for a production hybrid vehicle, which delivers approximately twice the output of the previous generation's battery despite similar physical dimensions, enabling more responsive acceleration and increased electric-only driving capability. The powertrain combines a more efficient 1.5-liter Dynamic Force engine with Toyota's latest hybrid system for a combined output of 91 horsepower, achieving a class-leading fuel economy of 35.8 km/L (84.3 mpg) in the WLTC Japanese test cycle. A new electronic four-wheel drive system (E-Four) is available for the first time, using an additional rear-mounted electric motor to provide enhanced traction when needed. The interior represents a significant upgrade with a standard 7-inch or optional 10.5-inch touchscreen infotainment system, digital instrument cluster, and improved materials throughout. Safety technology advances with the Toyota Safety Sense package including pre-collision system with pedestrian detection, lane tracing assist, and dynamic radar cruise control as standard equipment. An innovative feature is the power supply delivery system that can convert the Aqua's DC battery power to AC, allowing the vehicle to serve as a mobile power source during emergenciesâ€”an increasingly valued capability in disaster-prone Japan. The second-generation Aqua continues the model's mission of providing accessible hybrid technology in a practical compact package, now with enhanced performance, technology, and versatility that help maintain its position as one of Japan's most popular hybrid vehicles."
